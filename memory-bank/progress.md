## What's Left to Build/Improve
- **Performance Optimization**: Further optimize images and assets
- **Accessibility Improvements**: Ensure proper ARIA attributes and keyboard navigation
- **Content Updates**: Keep project listings and experience information current
- **Enhanced Interactivity**: Consider adding more interactive elements to showcase front-end skills
- **Additional Project Details**: Potentially expand project descriptions or add galleries
- **Code Documentation**: Add more inline documentation for future maintenance
- **Automated Testing**: Implement basic tests for functionality

## Current Status
The website is currently operational and deployed on GitHub Pages. It serves its primary purpose of showcasing Dmitriy's skills, experience, and projects. The site has a functional design with proper information architecture and content organization.

The memory bank documentation has been initialized to provide a comprehensive understanding of the project for future development and maintenance.

## Known Issues
1. **PDF Resume Synchronization**: PDF resumes need to be manually updated when the website content changes
2. **Language Toggle Implementation**: Current implementation using class toggling works but may not be the most scalable solution
3. **Mobile Menu Navigation**: Could be improved for better usability on smaller screens
4. **External Links Maintenance**: External links need regular verification to ensure they remain valid
5. **Image Optimization**: Some images may benefit from further optimization for faster loading
