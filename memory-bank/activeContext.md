# Active Context - Dmitriy Zatulovskiy's Portfolio Website

## Current Work Focus
The current focus is on initializing and documenting the project structure in the memory bank. This involves creating a comprehensive understanding of the portfolio website's architecture, design patterns, and technical implementation to facilitate future development and maintenance.

## Recent Changes
- Created the memory bank structure with all required core files:
  - `projectbrief.md`: Defined core requirements and goals
  - `productContext.md`: Outlined why the project exists and problems it solves
  - `systemPatterns.md`: Documented system architecture and design patterns
  - `techContext.md`: Detailed technologies used and development setup
  - `activeContext.md`: Tracking current work focus (this file)
  - `progress.md`: Documenting project progress and status

## Next Steps
1. **Current website analysis**:
   - Further analyze the current implementation to identify potential areas for improvement
   - Review responsive behavior across different device sizes
   - Check for accessibility issues

2. **Performance optimization**:
   - Audit current site performance using tools like Lighthouse
   - Identify opportunities for further image optimization
   - Review JavaScript for potential performance improvements

3. **Content updates**:
   - Review and update project listings with the most recent work
   - Ensure all links are current and working
   - Update career information if needed

4. **Technical improvements**:
   - Consider implementing a more robust language switching mechanism
   - Evaluate the potential for adding animations or transitions for better UX
   - Review and update dependencies to their latest stable versions

5. **Documentation**:
   - Complete documentation of the codebase
   - Create guidelines for future content updates

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Current Design Approach
The current design follows a traditional resume/CV layout with a sidebar containing personal information and a main content area for professional details. This approach is clear and familiar to users, but we should consider whether a more interactive or modern approach might better showcase Dmitriy's front-end development skills.

### Multilingual Implementation
The current implementation of multilingual support uses class toggling to show/hide content in different languages. While functional, we should consider whether a more scalable approach would be beneficial if additional languages need to be added in the future.

### Technology Stack
The use of Vite.js with SASS provides a modern development experience. We should continue to leverage these technologies while exploring potential enhancements like:
- Adding TypeScript for better code maintainability
- Implementing a component-based approach for better modularity
- Considering a lightweight framework if complexity increases

### Deployment Strategy
Currently using GitHub Pages for hosting. This approach is cost-effective and integrates well with the GitHub repository, but we should document the deployment process clearly for future updates.
